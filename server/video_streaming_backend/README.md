# Video Streaming

## Setup

First, we want to download all the requirements.

We want to create out own python virtual environment. To do this run the command `python3 -m venv <name of virtual environment>`.

To activate the environment run `source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate`. 

You will have to load the requirements manually. `requirements.txt` is not up to date.

## Usage 
To start the server, make sure you are in the `video_streaming_backend` folder then run  `python3 video_stream_server.py`. To start the client, open a new shell and follow the steps above to create and activate the environment. Then run `python3 video_stream_client.py`.

## Cleanup

To deactivate the environment, simply run the command `deactivate`
